Memory Match - Conentration game modelled after HBO's Silicon Valley. It has a pretty cool SIM city type of design. 

This was the most fun project I got to work on in class. I believe that would be because it's as fun to play as it was to make.

This is where my Javascript skills absolutely exploded in comparison to where I was before I joined LearningFuze Bootcamp. Learning how to more effecitvely use the console to my advantage really helped out a lot. Getting the fundamentals on procedural programming, jquery, logic flow, etc. My biggest sense of accomplishment was being able to run synchronus functions which let 5-6 different css/jquery animations to run, which makes a really unique effect when a player matches a card. Being able to see my game on my phone and play it when I'm standing on line in the grocery store has inspriing me to keep pushing forward in programming and see what else I can accomplish. When my friends tell me they play this game, it makes me want to keep developing.
